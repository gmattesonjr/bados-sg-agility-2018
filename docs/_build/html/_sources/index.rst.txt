F5 Agility Labs - Index
=======================

Welcome
-------
F5 Application Security Manager (ASM), Advanced WAF,
and DDoS Hybrid Defender products all include advanced functionality for
defending L7DoS attacks. In this self-paced lab, attendees will have an
opportunity to explore one component of the overall feature set, L7
Behavioral DoS (BaDOS), leverage BaDOS to mitigate various L7DoS
attacks, and examine the built-in reporting and monitoring functions
provided by ASM. At the conclusion of the lab, the attendee will have
comfort in the basics of BaDOS, how the feature is deployed, and the
types of attacks it can be used to mitigate.
