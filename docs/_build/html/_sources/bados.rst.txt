Introduction to |asm|/Advanced WAF Behavioral DoS 
----------------------------------------------------------

F5 Application Security Manager (ASM), Advanced WAF,
and DDoS Hybrid Defender products all include advanced functionality for
defending L7DoS attacks. In this self-paced lab, attendees will have an
opportunity to explore one component of the overall feature set, L7
Behavioral DoS (BaDOS), leverage BaDOS to mitigate various L7DoS
attacks, and examine the built-in reporting and monitoring functions
provided by ASM. At the conclusion of the lab, the attendee will have
comfort in the basics of BaDOS, how the feature is deployed, and the
types of attacks it can be used to mitigate.

Expected time to complete: 45-60 minutes

Getting Started

Please follow the instructions provided by the instructor to start your
lab and access your jump host.

.. NOTE::
	 All work for this lab will be performed exclusively from the Linux Workstation
	 jumphost. No installation or interaction with your local system is
	 required.

Lab Environments

1. Open a browser and go to `http://training.f5agililty.com/<lab
       number>/X <http://training.f5agililty.com/%3clab%20number%3e/X>`__
       (where **X** is your student number)

    a. Look for the **xubuntu-jumpbox-vxx**. You will use the xubuntu
       jumpbox for all the labs. (see below)

        |image2|

    b. You can click on **RDP** to RDP to the Xubuntu jumpbox or you can select the **CONSOLE** link and access the jumpbox via your browser.
   **The CONSOLE link requires you turn off pop-up blockers.**

2. Open the Chrome browser and log into the BIG-IP GUI to verify the
   BIG-IP is up.

   a. Go to **https://10.1.1.245**

      i.  User: **admin**

      ii. Password: **admin**

3. Now you will perform an initial configuration via command line.

   a. Open a terminal window from the taskbar at the bottom.

      i.   Log in to the BIG-IP using the command: **ssh
           root@10.1.1.245**

      ii.  The password is **default.**

      iii. At the BIG-IP prompt, enter **tmsh**

           1. This will place you in the BIG-IP command line mode.

   b. In your browser, open then the **Lab Guides** link on the
      bookmarks bar in a new tab/window.

   c. Open the **AdvWAF Base Setup.txt** file and review the commands.

   d. Copy all the commands between **# BEGIN COPY - Lab prep** and **#
      END COPY - Lab prep**

   e. Paste the commands into the terminal window at the **tmsh**
      prompt.

   f. **The BIG-IP will take several minutes to come back online.**

      i. Good time for a bathroom break. Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em.

4. Verify the virtual server and web site are up and running.

   a. Go to **Local Traffic >> Network Map**. There should be two
      virtual servers and all should be available (green).

   b. Open up the Firefox browser. Go to http://hackazon.f5demo.com and
      https://hackazon.f5demo.com
