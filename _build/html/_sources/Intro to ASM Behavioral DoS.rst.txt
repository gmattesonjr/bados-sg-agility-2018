**Agility 2018 Self-Guided Lab: Introduction to ASM/AWAF Behavioral
DoS**

**Class Name**: Self-Guided Lab – Introduction to ASM/AWAF Behavioral
DoS

**SE lead:** Michael Everett

**Description**: F5 Application Security Manager (ASM), Advanced WAF,
and DDoS Hybrid Defender products all include advanced functionality for
defending L7DoS attacks. In this self-guided lab, attendees will have an
opportunity to explore one component of the overall feature set, L7
Behavioral DoS (BaDOS), leverage BaDOS to mitigate various L7DoS
attacks, and examine the built-in reporting and monitoring functions
provided by ASM. At the conclusion of the lab, the attendee will have
comfort in the basics of BaDOS, how the feature is deployed, and the
types of attacks it can be used to mitigate.

**Prerequisites**: None, however, this class can be considered a
complement to the following Agility 4-hour labs:

-  Good WAF Security – Getting started with ASM

-  High and Maximum WAF Security – Maximizing ASM Protection

-  Mitigating Real World DDoS Attacks

-  Multilayer DDoS Defense
